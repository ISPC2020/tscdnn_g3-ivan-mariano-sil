    "\n",
    "According to *Universal Approximate Theorem*, Neural Networks can approximate as well as learn and represent any function given a large enough layer and desired error margin. The way neural network learns the true function is by building complex representations on top of simple ones. On each hidden layer, the neural network learns new feature space by first compute the affine (linear) transformations of the given inputs and then apply non-linear function which in turn will be the input of the next layer. This process will continue until we reach the output layer. Therefore, we can define neural network as information flows from inputs through hidden layers towards the output. For a 3-layers neural network, the learned function would be: $f(x) = f_3(f_2(f_1(x)))$ where:\n",
    "- $f_1(x)$: Function learned on first hidden layer\n",
    "- $f_2(x)$: Function learned on second hidden layer\n",
    "- $f_3(x)$: Function learned on output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, on each layer we learn different representation that gets more complicated with later hidden layers.Below is an example of a 3-layers neural network (we don't count input layer):\n",

    "For example, computers can't understand images directly and don't know what to do with pixels data. However, a neural network can build a simple representation of the image in the early hidden layers that identifies edges. Given the first hidden layer output, it can learn corners and contours. Given the second hidden layer, it can learn parts such as nose. Finally, it can learn the object identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since **truth is never linear** and representation is very critical to the performance of a machine learning algorithm, neural network can help us build very complex models and leave it to the algorithm to learn such representations without worrying about feature engineering that takes practitioners very long time and effort to curate a good representation. \n",

There are quite a few set of activation functions such *Rectified Linear Unit, Sigmoid, Hyperbolic tangent, etc*. Research has proven that deeper networks outperform networks with more hidden units.

    "- **Sigmoid function ($\\sigma$)**: $g(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$. It's recommended to be used only on the output layer so that we can easily interpret the output as probabilities since it has restricted output between 0 and 1. One of the main disadvantages for using sigmoid function on hidden layers is that the gradient is very close to zero over a large portion of its domain which makes it slow and harder for the learning algorithm to learn.\n",
    "- **Hyperbolic Tangent function**: $g(z) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}$. It's superior to sigmoid function in which the mean of its output is very close to zero, which in other words center the output of the activation units around zero and make the range of values very small which means faster to learn. The disadvantage that it shares with sigmoid function is that the gradient is very small on good portion of the domain.\n",
    "- **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**: $g(z) = max\\{0, z\\}$. The models that are close to linear are easy to optimize. Since ReLU shares a lot of the properties of linear functions, it tends to work well on most of the problems. The only issue is that the derivative is not defined at $z = 0$, which we can overcome by assigning the derivative to 0 at $z = 0$. However, this means that for $z\\leq 0$ the gradient is zero and again can't learn.\n",
    "- **Leaky Rectified Linear Unit**: $g(z) = max\\{\\alpha*z, z\\}$. It overcomes the zero gradient issue from ReLU and assigns $\\alpha$ which is a small value for $z\\leq 0$.\n",

    "The purpose of this notebook is to code Deep Neural Network step-by-step and explain the important concepts while doing that. We don't really care about the accuracy rate at this moment since there are tons of things we could've done to increase the accuracy which would be the subject of following notebooks. Below are some takeaways:\n",
    "- Even if neural network can represent any function, it may fail to learn for two reasons:\n",
    "    1. The optimization algorithm may fail to find the best value for the parameters of the desired (true) function.\n",
    "        It can stuck in a local optimum.\n",
    "    2. The learning algorithm may find different functional form that is different than the intended function due to overfitting.\n",
    "- Even if neural network rarely converges and always stuck in a local minimum, it is still able to reduce the cost significantly and come up with very complex models with high test accuracy.\n",
    "- The neural network we used in this notebook is standard fully connected network. However, there are two other kinds of networks:\n",
    "    - Convolutional NN: Where not all nodes are connected. It's best in class for image recognition.\n",
    "    - Recurrent NN: There is a feedback connections where output of the model is fed back into itself. It's used mainly in sequence modeling.\n",
    "- The fully connected neural network also forgets what happened in previous steps and also doesn't know anything about the output.\n",
    "- There are number of hyperparameters that we can tune using cross validation to get the best performance of our network:\n",
    "    1. Learning rate ($\\alpha$): Determines how big the step for each update of parameters.\n",
    "        - Small $\\alpha$ leads to slow convergence and may become computationally very expensive.\n",
    "        - Large $\\alpha$ may lead to overshooting where our learning algorithm may never converge.\n",
    "    2. Number of hidden layers (depth): The more hidden layers the better, but comes at a cost computationally.\n",
    "    3. Number of units per hidden layer (width): Research proven that huge number of hidden units per layer doesn't add to the improvement of the network.\n",
    "    4. Activation function: Which function to use on hidden layers differs among applications and domains. It's a trial and error process to try different functions and see which one works best.\n",
    "    5. Number of iterations.\n",
    "- Standardize data would help activation units have similar range of values and avoid gradients to go out of control."
